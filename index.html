      In HTML, any element can be editable. By using some JavaScript event
      handlers, you can transform your web page into a full and fast rich text
      editor. This article provides some information about this functionality.
      Note: In Firefox 63 Beta/Dev edition, some of the rich-text editing
      features have been disabled by default, for better cross-browser
      compatibility. These are object resizing on table or img , and
      absolutely-positioned elements; inline table editing to add or remove rows
      and columns; and the grabber that allows moving of absolutely-positioned
      elements. See bug 1449564 and Firefox-specific HTML editing UI has been
      deprecated for additional details.

      I am losing my interest in human beings; in the significance of their
      lives and their actions. Some one has said it is better to study one man
      than ten books. I want neither books nor men; they make me suffer. Can one
      of them talk to me like the night – the Summer night? Like the stars or
      the caressing wind? The night came slowly, softly, as I lay out there
      under the maple tree. It came creeping, creeping stealthily out of the
      valley, thinking I did not notice. And the outlines of trees and foliage
      nearby blended in one black mass and the night came stealing out from
      them, too, and from the east and west, until the only light was in the
      sky, filtering through the maple leaves and a star looking down through
      every cranny. The night is solemn and it means mystery. Human shapes
      flitted by like intangible things. Some stole up like little mice to peep
      at me. I did not mind. My whole being was abandoned to the soothing and
      penetrating charm of the night. The katydids began their slumber song:
      they are at it yet. How wise they are. They do not chatter like people.
      They tell me only: “sleep, sleep, sleep.” The wind rippled the maple
      leaves like little warm love thrills. Why do fools cumber the Earth! It
      was a man’s voice that broke the necromancer’s spell. A man came to-day
      with his “Bible Class.” He is detestable with his red cheeks and bold eyes
      and coarse manner and speech. What does he know of Christ? Shall I ask a
      young fool who was born yesterday and will die tomorrow to tell me things
      of Christ? I would rather ask the stars: they have seen him.
